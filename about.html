<h3 class="content-head">Concussion Protocol</h3>
<p>Our rookie bot, named "Concussion Protocol", has led us to victory many time and we still continue to run it for demos and public events. Concussion Protocol was named after our first competition with it. During most of our matches, the radio would "brown" out in the middle of a match after a hard impact. We finally found and fixed the issue, but thats why we named it "Concussion Protocol".</p>
